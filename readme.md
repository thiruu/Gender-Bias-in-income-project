Significant difference in income between men and women (R programming) 

? Statistically researched 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth raw dataset from Bureau of Labor Statistics to reveal insights on gender bias in income and to see if the difference varies depending on factors such as education, profession, marriage status, etc.

? Cleansed the raw data by handling the missing values, gave meaningful names for variables and factor levels, and dropped variables based on correlation matrix, generated graphs to understand the distribution of data.

? Ran Tobit regression models with and without interaction to explain the relationship between income & other significant variables.
